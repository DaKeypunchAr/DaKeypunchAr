- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @DaKeypunchAr (Real Name: Krishna Keshari)
  My name is Krishna Keshari. I live in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh (U.P.), India.
  I'm 14 yo at the time of writing this but yeah am soon 15.
  The thing you gotta remember about me is I'm a curious person. I have no goal in my life except keep learning.
  Hence, You may call me goalless.

  I've been programming since 11 (or 12 i don't remember quite. maybe i was near 12).
  My motivation was Scratch (The Visual Programming Language) that I found out in my Computer book (though It was not taught but I'm a curious person).
  In the covid time, I found out scratch. I didn't had computer though. Till the end of covid I got a computer for online classes (well the covid ended lol).
  I did scratch for a month. Then switched to python. Did that also for 2-3 months. Thought of switching to C++ because python seemed slow
  while I was making a game because it seemed slow (maybe my code sucked or I had time.sleep() anywhere. üíÄ) But as you can expect. Python to C++ was a freaking nightmare.
  So what I did is I learnt Java and did that for a year and a half. Made 2-3 games in it with java.swing and java.awt packages (They are not supposed to be used to make games but yeah dumb me)
  I then thought of doing some web dev. Did some of the frontend using CSS and HTML and JS (obviously) with some graphics design and used figma. Maybe for 2-3 months.
  Then switched to C++ learnt it. And now I love it. I know the feeling of control that I have with it. I've used OpenGL with GLFW and GLEW (well i'll use GLAD afterwards) to make many games
  and learn it overall. I can read assembly a little bit. Know how computer architecture works and yeah. Well doing C++ at the time of writing for 1 and a half year.

  The only book I've read fully and in 1 day except my school books is "But how Do it Know?" by "J. Clark Scott".

  I'm sick with HLS (Header Love Syndrome). and yes. I PREFER TABS. *WHY The default thing is with spaces ahh. Am not rewriting*.
  
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in Game Development, Graphics Programming, Computer Architecture and so on.
  I've done some Game Jams (yeah 2 of them and i'm not that good cz I don't use any game engines but use OpenGL and C++)
  Because I'm a Low-Level person. I've did Graphics Programming cz OpenGL ofc. I'll also make some things mimicking the cpu architecture.
  Like an emulated CPU or something.
  
- üå± I‚Äôm currently thinking to learn new programming languages like Zig, GoLang and Rust.
  I've seen many people that hate C/C++. They use Rust, Zig or GoLang. I want to try those. Also I'm a little bit in love with Headers.
  I want to have every little perspective so that I can find the eternal truth. Well I know somethings are better in their own field.
  Like C++ is best for game dev but python is good for small scripts or simple programs.

- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on any project. I'm a curious person and like to learn everything.
  Well I literally have no experience with teams. So I would love to collaborate on anything if given enough knowledge (or I have it).
  
- üì´ How to reach me.
  You can mail me at 0dakeypunchar0@gmail.com or I'm on discord Username: "0dakeypunchar0" without the quotes.
  
- üòÑ Pronouns: He/Him
  I'm a male homo sapien.
  
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I'm a Homo-Sapien. I am a Pokemon Fan.
